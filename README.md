## Introduction 

```
Welcome to our project on finding concerts based on location, genre, and distance! As music lovers, we understand the excitement of discovering new artists and attending live shows. However, searching for concerts that match your preferences can be a time-consuming and overwhelming task. So this website will simplify this process by allowing users to enter their location, preferred music genre, and maximum distance willing to travel and a list of upcoming concerts, as well as new song and artist recommendations which appear at the bottom of the search for the user which makes the search for new music and concerts easier.

*Search by location: Users can search for concerts in their preferred location by entering the city or town zip code they are interested in.

*Search by genre: Users can also search for concerts based on their favorite music genre. The application has a wide range of music genres to choose from.

*Distance filter: Our application allows users to filter their search results by distance.

*Spotify integration: With the help of Spotify, we are able to provide our users with new song and artist recommendations after they start their search for concerts.

## Technologies Used

```
*HTML/CSS/Javascript
*jQuery
*Spotify/Ticket Master API's
*Bulma
```

## Challenges Faced

```
1. Being able to fetch data from both APIs was a big struggle for us but we eventually managed to get data to load from our APIs.

2. Getting the Spotify content to load into the browser was another time consuming issue we had, but we managed to pull songs and artists data into our website.

3. Our goal was to merge four input text areas into a single search bar and insert icons as placeholders. We attempted various techniques, and ultimately achieved success using the Bulma library .

## Future Improvements

```
1. Local Storage: To improve usability, we have implemented a local storage feature that allows users to save their preferences and search results for future reference, eliminating the need to input the same data repeatedly.

2. Secure Login: In order to protect user data and ensure privacy, our platform features a secure login system that connects with a centralized database to authenticate user credentials.

3. Artist Search: To provide a more comprehensive search experience, our engine allows users to search for concerts by artist in addition to other criteria such as location and date.

4. Ticket Purchasing: We have streamlined the ticket purchasing process by allowing users to purchase tickets directly through our website, eliminating the need to navigate to external ticketing sites.
Additional Data: Our platform provides users with a wealth of information related to their search results, including artist bios, setlists, and other relevant details.

5. Artist History: To give users a more immersive experience, we have included a feature that displays the history of the artist or band when the user clicks on the artist tab.

6. Purchase History: To improve user experience and allow for easier management of past purchases, our engine maintains a history of all tickets purchased through the platform.
